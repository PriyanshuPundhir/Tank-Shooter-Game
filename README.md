# Tank-Shooter-Game
At starting a tank is spawn and we have infinite cannons. There are 10 number of enemies in the field who will follow tank where ever it go.If the tank is standing still enemy will stop at a certain direction.We have to shoot all enemies to finish this game. There are 2 types of camera views normal and zoomed. In field there are boxes placed in certain places we can also shoot them they will burst into small pieces. I have also used water animation for a river effect to make it look more beautiful. And there are many other assets which makes the game more intreasting.
